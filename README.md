# Autoware_steamdeck
Hello ya! \
I create this project to record the process to auto drive a Mec-car by steamdeck. \

and firstly i would like to use the opensource framework **Autoware**,because the steamdeck hardware could fit the requirements just right! \
-CPU with 8 cores \
-16GB RAM \
-[Optional] NVIDIA GPU (4GB RAM) \
and what's more, deck is portable!^_^ \

Hope this project has a good result!
